==========
Article recommendation, based on the user's history.

## Status
Data collecting and analysis has finished, right now I am working on the front-end.

## Tech
- Data collecting: [spiderer](https://github.com/HelloCodeMing/spiderer)
- Database: MongoDB
- Feature extraction: TFIDF and cosine similarity.
- Recommendation: content-based on the early stage, maybe use item-based or other algorithms later.
- Front-end: [express](https://github.com/strongloop/express) in node.js
- Language: node.js and Scala.

## Aim
At first, I try to develop a news discovery tool based on location. I thought for a long time even dreamed about how to make money with it. 

But I met some difficulties on the first day, I failed to start the project, disappointingly. 

Instead, I start this project, also interested and not beyond my ability. I have worked on it for two weeks, maybe several days later I will finish it. It's really challenging to use Scala in a project, and mixed with node.js.
